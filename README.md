## Formatting your submission

To adhere to the table format of this page, please add your meetup line to the [Comcal.md](https://github.com/tbridge/macadminscomcal/blob/master/Comcal.md) file in the following format:

```
| [Meetup Group Name](http://RSVP_or_meetup.link) | [Location](https://map_or_venue.link) | Month Date at time | Cost |
```
To ensure consistency and clarity of times across timezones, please use the following format for the time of the meetup:

```
8 November 2018, 7:00 p.m. ET
```
Standard/Daylight time can be specified in the timezone, otherwise use the generic timezome acronym (e.g., CT for Central Time, MT for Mountain Time).

Please be mindful of line breaks, as they can impact the table formatting on the page.
